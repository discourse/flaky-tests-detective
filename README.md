# Flaky Tests Detective

The idea behind this project is to detect and report flaky tests in our codebase by running our Ruby/JS suite and collect failures.

The public API is inside the `Detective` class, which use some simple collaborators:

#### Archives

They give us a handy API, which is used to find/save reports. 

#### Printers

They translate a report to a different format. This is useful when creating human-readable reports.  Supported formats are Plain text and Markdown.

#### Parsers

They parse the output generated by our suite, extracting valuable information. This helps us to diagnose and deal with these problematic tests.

### Requirements

- Ruby
- Docker

### Usage

- Clone repo && cd into it.
